;;This is a note about the modifications for 2023-2024 DVCS experiment in Hall C
;;Below are the modifications to Hosan's version till 2025/2/24
;;To check Hosan's version, see https://github.com/gboon18/HallC_NPS/tree/master/DVCS_evt_gen

- DVCS.cc
    - Turned OFF the sweeping magnet (SM_field_flag = false)
    - Modified the density of LH2 and LD2 targets https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/AtomicNuclearProperties/
- B5HadCalorimeterHit.cc, CrystalCoverHit.cc, CrystalFrontCoverHit.cc, PMTcoverHit.cc
    - fOP_String(""): Modified to run with Geant version 4.11
- DetectorConstruction.cc
    - Target cell
        - Target length: modified to Hall C target length
        - fTargetCoverLength, fTargetCoverRadius, fTargetWindowThickness: modified to the average of 3 target cells in Hall C
    - NPS geometry
        - Increase the gap between crystals from 0.5 to 1 mm
        - Add 30*1e-3 mm to fWrapThickness for Tedlar
    - Density of LD2: changed from 0.167 to 0.1638 g/cm^3 (PDG, 2024)
    - Modified Optics related arrays and properties to run with Geant version 4.11
- EventAction.cc
    - Added 1080 random numbers for mis-calibration test
    - Added lines to print out message every 10% of event number
    - Aove the branch “edep[1080]” from Tree “T” to “t_dvcs”
    - Added the generated Vx and Vy to DefinePrimaries
- HistoManager.cc
